## SetUp
- Install Dependencies:
  - Ensure Python 3.x is installed on your system.
  - Pygame

## Functions
- The player function takes a board state as input, and return which playerâ€™s turn it is (either X or O).
- The actions function returns a set of all of the possible actions that can be taken on a given board. Each action is represented by a tuple.
- The result function takes a board and an action as input, and should return a new board state, without modifying the original board. A deep copy of the board was made to use and modify.
- The winner function accepts a board as input, and return the winner of the board if there is one. Winners are either X or O and a tie returns None as the result.
- The terminal function accepts a board as input, and return a boolean value indicating whether the game is over.
- The utility function accepts a terminal board as input and output the utility of the board.
- The minimax function takes a board as input, and return the optimal move for the player to move on that board.

## Algorithm
The AI opponent uses the minimax algorithm to make strategic decisions:

- Maximize Win: The AI seeks to maximize its chances of winning by choosing moves that lead to victory.
- Minimize Loss: It also works to minimize the opponent's chances of winning, ensuring a challenging gameplay experience.
